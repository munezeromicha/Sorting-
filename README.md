## Code Quality and Statistics

This project uses the C/C++ Linter GitHub Action to ensure code quality and the Tokei tool to provide code statistics.

The C/C++ Linter GitHub Action runs clang-tidy and clang-format to collect feedback in the form of file-annotations, thread-comments, workflow step-summary, and Pull Request reviews.

The Tokei tool provides detailed statistics about the code, including lines of code, number of files, and more.

You can view the latest C/C++ Linter GitHub Action status and Tokei code statistics in the badges at the top of this README.
